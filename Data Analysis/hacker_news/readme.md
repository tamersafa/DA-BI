We're interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.

Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
3. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more points on average?
4. Are posts created at a certain time more likely to receive more points?
5. Compare results to the average number of comments and points other posts receive.
